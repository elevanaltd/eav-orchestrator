# Security Tests

This directory contains comprehensive security boundary tests for the EAV Orchestrator multi-tenant collaborative editing system.

## Test Files

### `boundary.test.ts`
Comprehensive security boundary tests covering:
- **Project Isolation**: Multi-tenant data separation
- **CRDT Room Isolation**: Y.js update boundaries
- **Role-Based Access Control**: 5-role permission matrix
- **Data Boundary Enforcement**: Anti-enumeration and injection protection
- **RLS Policy Validation**: Database-level security verification
- **CustomSupabaseProvider Security**: Real-time collaboration security

**Status**: ✅ 18/18 tests passing
**Security Specialist Approved**: SECURITY-SPECIALIST-20250918-0fe0c277

### `SECURITY_MODEL.md`
Complete documentation of the security architecture including:
- Multi-tenant isolation mechanisms
- Role-based access control implementation
- CRDT security boundaries
- Circuit breaker security patterns
- Security test coverage analysis
- Identified strengths and recommendations

## Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm test tests/security/

# Run specific boundary tests
npm test tests/security/boundary.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage tests/security/
```

## Security Model Overview

### 5-Role Access Control
- **Admin**: System-wide access
- **Internal**: Organization-wide editing
- **Freelancer**: Project-specific editing
- **Client**: Review and approval only
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Key Security Features
1. **Project Isolation**: Complete tenant separation via RLS policies
2. **Real-time Security**: Project-scoped Y.js channels
3. **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Resilient security controls
4. **Input Validation**: SQL injection and enumeration prevention
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete operation logging

## Test Categories

| Category | Tests | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Project Isolation | 3 | Verify multi-tenant boundaries |
| CRDT Room Isolation | 2 | Test Y.js update separation |
| Role-Based Access | 4 | Validate permission matrix |
| Data Boundaries | 3 | Prevent unauthorized access |
| RLS Validation | 3 | Database security verification |
| Provider Security | 3 | Real-time collaboration security |

## Security Validation

The security tests validate that:
- ✅ Users cannot access unauthorized projects
- ✅ Y.js updates don't leak between projects
- ✅ Role permissions are correctly enforced
- ✅ RLS policies block unauthorized database access
- ✅ Circuit breakers protect against security failures
- ✅ Error messages don't reveal sensitive information

## Expected Test Behavior

**Important**: The security tests include expected permission denied errors in stderr output. These errors indicate the security controls are working correctly:

```
stderr | Failed to persist Y.js update: permission denied for function append_yjs_update
stderr | Error loading initial state: permission denied
stderr | Circuit breaker blocked or failed persist operation
```

These are **POSITIVE security indicators** showing unauthorized access is being blocked.

## Continuous Security

- **Automated Testing**: All security tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- **Security Specialist Review**: Architecture changes require specialist approval
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly security model review scheduled
- **Performance Monitoring**: RLS policy execution time tracking
