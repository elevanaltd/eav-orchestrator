### Repository Comparison

| Aspect | Current Build Repo (Active) | Old Complex Repo (Reference) |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Status** | ðŸŸ¢ Active Development | ðŸ“š Reference/Archive |
| **Structure** | Streamlined monolith | Complex modular (modules/, system/, libs/) |
| **File Count** | ~80 files | 425 files |
| **Testing Framework** | Vitest (modern) | Jest (legacy) |
| **Architecture** | Clean, focused build | Multiple modules + BFF + UI layers |
| **Purpose** | Production implementation | Research & experimentation |
| **Branch** | B2-Build | Various experimental branches |
| **Salvage Status** | Implementing proven patterns | Source of proven patterns |

These instructions guide Claude Code in developing the EAV Orchestrator system following the strategic approach of selective salvage from the complex old repository, preventing 60-80% development waste by focusing on proven patterns.

## Proactive Context-Gathering Protocol

**MANDATORY: Your first action for any new task is to prepare the context.** Do not begin analysis or coding until you have completed this protocol.

### Phase 1: Context Initialization
1. **Verify Codebase is Packed:** 
   - First, check if `.claude/session.vars` exists
   - If not, run the hook: `bash .claude/hooks/post-session-start.sh` (if it exists)
   - Then check for a Repomix `outputId` in `.claude/session.vars`
   - If no outputId exists, run `mcp__repomix__pack_codebase` and save the new ID to both:
     - `.claude/session.vars` as `REPOMIX_OUTPUT_ID=<outputId>`
     - `.claude/last-pack-id.txt` as just the outputId

2. **Analyze the Task:** Read the user's request and extract 2-4 key nouns, function names, or concepts (e.g., "CustomSupabaseProvider", "circuitBreaker", "database migration").

3. **Search the Codebase:** Use `mcp__repomix__grep_repomix_output` for each keyword you identified. Use a context of 3-5 lines to understand the surrounding code.

4. **Cross-Reference Checks:** ALWAYS perform these additional searches:
   - **Dependency Check:** Search for imports/requires in found files
   - **Pattern Check:** Search for common patterns (cache, retry, auth, validation, circuit, provider, manager)
   - **Impact Radius:** Search for files that import the one being modified
   - **Architecture Check:** Grep for architectural patterns mentioned in README/CLAUDE.md

5. **Present Your Findings:** Synthesize the results into a brief summary. Start your response with: **"I have prepared the context. Here is what I found relevant to your request:"**
   - List the key files that appeared in the search
   - Show 1-2 of the most relevant code snippets from your search
   - Identify any existing patterns that relate to the task
   - State that you are now ready to proceed with the task

This protocol transforms the workflow from "go find context" to "I have found the context for you."

### Phase 2: Precedent Search Protocol

**Before implementing ANY new pattern** (caching, error handling, retry logic, authentication, etc.):

1. **Search for existing implementations:** Use `mcp__repomix__grep_repomix_output(outputId, "pattern_name")` to find existing examples
2. **If found:** Follow the existing pattern for consistency
3. **If not found:** Check architectural docs (README.md, CLAUDE.md, ADR files) for guidance
4. **Only create new pattern** after confirming no precedent exists and documenting why

### Phase 3: Impact Analysis

**Before making changes:**

1. **Identify dependencies:** What calls this code? What does this code call?
2. **Check test coverage:** Search for existing tests of the code being modified
3. **Verify architectural fit:** Does this change align with system patterns?
4. **Consider side effects:** What else might be affected by this change?

This ensures changes fit the bigger picture and maintain system coherence.

## Project Context & Constraints

### Business Requirements
- **Scale:** 10-20 concurrent users, support for 100s of projects
- **Philosophy:** 95% automation with manual overrides
- **Performance:** P95 â‰¤ 500ms saves, <2s page loads for script editing
- **Growth Target:** Support 3x current project volume

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design:** Script Module first, then phased expansion
- **Realistic Scaling:** Build for actual needs, not theoretical maximums
- **Clean Data Architecture:** UUID primary keys, human-readable display fields
- **Parallel Processing:** Non-blocking workflows, sensible defaults

## Development Standards

### TRACED Protocol Compliance
All development activities must follow TRACED protocol with evidence receipts:

- **T**est: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle, failing tests before implementation
- **R**eview: Code review specialist consultation for all changes
- **A**nalyze: Critical engineer consultation for architectural decisions
- **C**onsult: Specialist consultation at mandatory trigger points
- **E**xecute: Quality gates (lint, typecheck, tests) with CI/CD evidence
- **D**ocument: TodoWrite throughout, Implementation Log updates

### Quality Gates
- **TDD Mandatory:** Write failing test before implementation
- **No Code Without Tests:** All new files must have corresponding test files
- **Coverage Diagnostic:** 80% guideline (not gate), focus on behavior validation
- **Evidence Required:** Links to CI jobs, review comments, test execution receipts

### Consultation Triggers
- **Architecture decisions:** `technical-architect` or `critical-engineer`
- **Code changes:** `code-review-specialist`
- **Testing issues:** `testguard` (mandatory for test manipulation prevention)
- **Complex systems:** `complexity-guard` for >3 layers
- **North Star conflicts:** `requirements-steward`

## Script Module First Implementation

Based on Script Module North Star, initial development focuses on:

### Core Features (Week 1-2) - COMPLETED âœ…
- âœ… Collaborative script editing (TipTap rich text editor integrated)
- âœ… Real-time commenting system (Y.js CRDT operational)
- âœ… Simple 3-state approval workflow (created â†’ in_edit â†’ approved)
- âœ… Component-to-scene 1:1 mapping structure
- âœ… Role-based access control (5 roles with RLS policies)
- âœ… Circuit breaker resilience (Opossum library integrated)
- âœ… Auto-save memory leak resolution (proper timer cleanup)

### Performance Requirements
- 10-20 concurrent users smooth operation
- Comment sync: <200ms latency
- Presence indicators: <500ms updates
- Support 50-100 components per script

### Quality Criteria
- No data loss during concurrent editing
- Zero internal data visible to clients
- 100% componentâ†”scene mapping maintained
- All changes traceable through audit trail

## Current Known Issues (B2-Build)

### TypeScript Type Mismatch in Feature Tests
The feature test files have type errors because of conflicting ScriptComponent definitions:
- `/src/types/scriptComponent.ts`: Uses snake_case (`component_id`, `script_id`, `position`)
- `/src/types/editor.ts`: Previously had camelCase interface, now re-exports from scriptComponent
- **Feature tests**: Expect camelCase properties (`id`, `scriptId`) but getting snake_case

This is a known issue with RED state TDD tests that will be resolved when the component management features are implemented.
