## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Y.js as Single Source of Truth
**Decision:** Y.js documents maintain authoritative state for collaborative content
**Rationale:** Conflict-free editing requires CRDT as primary data source
**Implementation:** Database stores Y.js binary state with content sync via triggers

### 2. Position Column Type Fix
**Critical Fix:** Changed from INTEGER to DOUBLE PRECISION for Y.js position tracking
**Impact:** Prevents data corruption during collaborative editing
**Evidence:** Issue identified during holistic system assessment

### 3. Optimistic Locking Strategy
**Pattern:** version_number field with increment-on-update triggers
**Purpose:** Prevent lost updates during concurrent operations
**Scope:** Applied to script_components and script_scenes tables

### 4. Circuit Breaker Integration
**Library:** Opossum with production-grade configuration
**Thresholds:** 5000ms timeout, 30% error rate, 20000ms reset
**Fallback:** Offline queue with localStorage persistence

## NEXT SESSION STARTING POINT

### IMMEDIATE TASKS (Priority 1)
1. **Apply Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project root
   cd /Volumes/HestAI-Projects/eav-orchestrator/build

   # Apply migration 003
   npx supabase db push

   # Verify schema
   npx supabase db diff
   ```

2. **Verify Database Schema**
   - Test table creation and constraints
   - Validate RLS policies are active
   - Confirm Y.js document storage

3. **Test Y.js Integration**
   ```bash
   # Run Y.js specific tests
   npm run test -- --grep "Y.js\|CRDT\|collaborative"

   # Test ScriptEditor with authentication
   npm run test -- src/components/editor/ScriptEditor.auth-integration.test.tsx
   ```

### FEATURE DEVELOPMENT (Priority 2)
1. **Script Editor Enhancement**
   - Integrate Y.js provider with new database schema
   - Test collaborative editing with multiple users
   - Validate auto-save and conflict resolution

2. **Real-time Features**
