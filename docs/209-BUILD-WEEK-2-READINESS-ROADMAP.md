## Week 2 Implementation Targets

### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Collaborative Script Editor Implementation

**FOUNDATION READY FOR:**
1. **Y.js CRDT Integration** - Real-time collaborative editing without conflicts
2. **TipTap Rich Text Editor** - Professional script editing experience
3. **Component-Scene Mapping** - 1:1 relationship with optimistic locking
4. **Real-time Comment System** - <200ms latency collaboration
5. **Role-based Access Control** - 5-role system with Supabase RLS

### WEEK 2 IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

#### Phase 2A: Y.js Collaboration Foundation (Days 1-2)
**IMMEDIATE DEPENDENCIES (Final 15% of Week 1):**
- Install `y-indexeddb` npm package for local persistence
- Implement `encoding.ts` utility (50-100 LOC) for Y.js binary operations
- Implement `persistence.ts` utility (50-100 LOC) for Supabase synchronization
- Verify YjsSupabaseProvider integration with test validation

**COLLABORATIVE EDITOR CORE:**
- Integrate Y.js Document with TipTap editor binding
- Implement real-time synchronization with Supabase provider
- Test conflict-free collaborative editing with multiple cursors
- Validate presence awareness and user indicators

#### Phase 2B: Script Component Management (Days 2-3)
**OPTIMISTIC LOCKING INTEGRATION:**
- Connect ScriptComponentManager with collaborative editor
- Implement component-to-scene 1:1 mapping with conflict detection
- Create component ordering system with fractional indexing
- Test concurrent component modifications with version control

**COMPONENT LIFECYCLE:**
- Script creation with initial component structure
- Real-time component addition/removal with CRDT consistency  
- Component content editing with optimistic locking protection
- Component reordering with conflict-free operations

#### Phase 2C: 3-State Approval Workflow (Days 3-4)
**WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION:**
- `created` state: Initial script with editing capabilities
- `in_edit` state: Collaborative editing active, version tracking
- `approved` state: Final version locked, read-only with audit trail

**ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL:**
- Admin: Full script management and approval authority
- Internal: Script creation, editing, approval workflow participation
- Freelancer: Assigned script editing with component restrictions
- Client: Read-only access to approved scripts with comment capability
- Viewer: Read-only access to approved scripts only

#### Phase 2D: Real-time Comment System (Days 4-5)
**COMMENT INFRASTRUCTURE:**
- Real-time comment synchronization with <200ms latency target
- Comment threading and resolution workflow
- Comment persistence with Supabase real-time subscriptions
- User presence and typing indicators for active collaboration

**INTEGRATION TESTING:**
- Multi-user collaborative editing scenarios
- Concurrent comment creation and response workflows
- Role-based access validation across all collaboration features
- Performance validation against P95 ≤ 500ms targets

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

#### Performance Requirements
- **Concurrent Users:** 10-20 smooth operation validated
- **Comment Sync Latency:** <200ms (P95) 
- **Save Operations:** ≤500ms (P95) with optimistic locking
- **Presence Updates:** <500ms visibility across all users
- **Components Per Script:** 3-18 typical, tested up to 50

#### Quality Criteria Validation
- **Zero Data Loss:** CRDT + optimistic locking prevents conflicts
- **Client Data Privacy:** No internal data visible through RLS enforcement
- **Component-Scene Mapping:** 100% consistency maintained through versioning
- **Audit Trail:** All changes traceable with user attribution and timestamps

### TRACED Protocol Compliance

#### Test-First Development
- **T-Test:** Failing tests for each collaborative feature before implementation
- **R-Review:** Code review specialist consultation for editor integration
- **A-Analyze:** Critical engineer validation for CRDT architecture decisions
- **C-Consult:** TestGuard for collaborative testing discipline
- **E-Execute:** Quality gates with collaborative scenario validation
- **D-Document:** Implementation log updates with collaboration evidence

#### Evidence Requirements
- Multi-user collaboration test scenarios with recorded behavior
- Performance benchmarks for comment sync and presence updates
- Role-based access control validation across all user types
- Conflict resolution testing with concurrent editing scenarios

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency

### IDENTIFIED RISKS
1. **Y.js Integration Complexity:** Mitigated by reference system salvaged patterns
2. **Real-time Performance:** Addressed by Supabase provider optimization
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Handled by optimistic locking + CRDT combination
4. **Role-based Security:** Validated through Supabase RLS implementation

### CONTINGENCY PLANS
- **Y.js Issues:** Fall back to simpler real-time editing with manual conflict resolution
- **Performance Problems:** Implement debouncing and client-side optimization  
- **Security Concerns:** Enhance RLS policies with additional validation layers
- **Timeline Pressure:** Prioritize core collaborative editing over advanced features

## Week 3 Preparation

### INTEGRATION READINESS
With Week 2 collaborative editor complete, Week 3 focuses on:
- SmartSuite API integration using established circuit breaker patterns
- External voice generation integration (ElevenLabs) with BFF security
- Production performance optimization and monitoring implementation
- Security audit with reference system testing patterns

### SUCCESS METRICS
- **Collaborative Editing:** Multi-user script editing operational
- **Comment System:** Real-time collaboration with <200ms latency
- **Role Security:** 5-role access control fully functional
- **Performance:** P95 ≤ 500ms maintained under collaborative load
- **Quality Gates:** 95%+ test success rate with collaborative scenarios
