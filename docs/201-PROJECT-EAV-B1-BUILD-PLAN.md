# EAV Orchestrator Build Plan

**Project:** EAV Orchestrator - Collaborative Video Production System  
**Phase:** B1 - Planning & Build Roadmap  
**Created:** 2025-08-19  
**Status:** Placeholder - Awaiting B0 Vision & Analysis completion

## Build Plan Overview

This document will contain the detailed build plan following completion of the B0 Vision & Analysis Document. 

**Prerequisites:**
- B0 Vision & Analysis Document complete
- Technology stack decisions finalized 
- Architectural decisions recorded in ADR
- Team roles assigned

## Planned Structure

### 1. Technology Stack & Architecture
- [Pending B0] Database selection and schema design
- [Pending B0] Backend framework and API design
- [Pending B0] Frontend framework and real-time architecture
- [Pending B0] Authentication and authorization approach
- [Pending B0] Deployment and infrastructure approach

### 2. Module Breakdown
Based on the North Star documents, the build will focus on:

#### Script Module (First Priority)
- Collaborative script editing with TipTap rich text
- Real-time commenting and presence indicators
- Simple 3-state approval workflow
- Component-to-scene mapping preparation
- Role-based access control (5 roles)

#### Future Modules (Phased Approach)
- Voice generation and version control module
- Scene and shot management module
- Asset management and storage module
- Review and approval workflow module

### 3. Development Phases
- [Pending] Detailed task breakdown with estimates
- [Pending] Milestone definitions and acceptance criteria
- [Pending] Testing strategy and quality gates
- [Pending] Integration points and handoff procedures

## Key Constraints & Requirements

### Performance Targets (From Script Module North Star)
- Save latency: P95 â‰¤ 500ms for 10-20 users
- Page load: < 2 seconds
- Comment sync: < 200ms
- Presence updates: < 500ms

### Scale Requirements (From System North Star)
- 10-20 concurrent users
- 100s of projects (not 1000s)
- 50-100 components per script maximum
- Support for 3x growth target

## Critical Dependencies

### External Decisions Required
- VO versioning approach final confirmation (System North Star line 34)
- Team role assignments for implementation phases
- Infrastructure hosting decisions

### Technical Dependencies
- Database schema design aligned with UUID strategy
- Real-time communication architecture (WebSocket/SSE)
- Authentication provider selection
- File storage and proxy generation approach
