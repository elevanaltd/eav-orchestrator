# B1 BUILD PLAN - EAV Orchestrator Implementation Roadmap

**Project:** EAV Orchestrator - Collaborative Video Production System  
**Phase:** B1 - Build Execution Roadmap  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Status:** CONSTITUTIONAL BASELINE COMPLETE - Week 1 Infrastructure Ready  
**Prerequisites:** 106-DOC-B0-VALIDATION.md (CONDITIONAL GO approved)  
**Infrastructure Status:** Testing framework stabilized, TDD infrastructure operational

## Executive Summary

This BUILD PLAN transforms the validated B0 architecture into a 5-week implementation roadmap addressing 3 critical production blockers while delivering a functional Script Module with collaborative editing capabilities.

### Critical Success Factors
- **Week 1:** Resolve all 3 production-blocking issues before feature development
- **Week 2-5:** Implement Script Module core with real-time collaboration  
- **TRACED Protocol:** Evidence-based quality gates throughout execution
- **Performance Targets:** P95 ≤ 500ms saves, <200ms comment sync

### MVP Scope Clarification
```yaml
MVP_Scope_Clarification:
  Initial_Users: 1-2 concurrent (MVP validation phase)
  Architecture: Built for 10-20 users from day 1
  Rationale: "Correct architecture scales; wrong architecture requires rewrite"
  Critical_Decision: Use Yjs + Supabase together, not simplified alternatives
  Implementation_Note: |
    - Start with fewer users for easier testing/debugging
    - Use industry-standard CRDT pattern (Yjs) from day 1
    - No architectural shortcuts that require future rewrites
    - Critical-Engineer validated: LWW = data loss, not simplification
```

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS RESOLUTION (Week 1)

Based on **106-DOC-B0-VALIDATION.md** findings, 3 critical production blockers must be resolved in Week 1 before any feature development begins.

### Blocker 1: Concurrent Edit Data Loss Protection [CRITICAL]
**Status:** MUST FIX BEFORE ANY FEATURE DEVELOPMENT  
**Technical Solution:** Optimistic locking using version column with pg_advisory_locks for atomicity  
**Source:** 106-DOC-B0-VALIDATION.md lines 33-43

```yaml
Task_1A_Database_Schema:
  Duration: 4 hours
  Dependencies: None
  Success_Criteria: Version column added to all editable tables with advisory lock support
  TRACED_T: Write failing test for concurrent edit scenario
  TRACED_R: Code review for schema migration safety
  Technical_Solution: Optimistic locking using a version column, with pg_advisory_locks to ensure atomicity of the read-increment-write operation
  SQL_Implementation: |
    ALTER TABLE script_components 
      ADD COLUMN version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
      ADD COLUMN updated_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

Task_1B_Yjs_CRDT_Implementation:
  Duration: 8 hours  
  Dependencies: [Task_1A_Database_Schema]
  Success_Criteria: Yjs CRDT integration prevents all concurrent edit conflicts
  TRACED_T: Test concurrent user editing same component
  TRACED_E: Integration test suite passing
  Implementation: |
    - Yjs document state management (CRDT for conflict-free editing)
    - Supabase Realtime for update broadcasting (transport layer)
    - Persist Yjs state to Postgres bytea column on debounce
    - NO last-write-wins (data loss unacceptable even for 1 user)
  // Critical-Engineer: Yjs + Supabase validated for correct collaboration
```

### Blocker 2: External API Failure Isolation [HIGH]  
**Status:** ARCHITECTURAL DECISION COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Technical Solution:** Serverless functions with Vercel KV circuit breaker state management  
**Source:** 106-DOC-B0-VALIDATION.md lines 45-55

### Blocker 3: Component Position Performance [HIGH]
**Status:** PREVENTS SCRIPT REORDERING AT SCALE

**Source:** 106-DOC-B0-VALIDATION.md lines 57-64

```yaml
Task_3A_Fractional_Index_Schema:
  Duration: 6 hours
  Dependencies: None
  Success_Criteria: Position column accepts fractional string values
  TRACED_T: Test ordering with 1000+ components

User_Management_and_Security:
  - 100% of user authentication and authorization functional (5-role system)
  - 100% of RLS policies tested and validated for data isolation
  - 100% of role-based feature access working correctly
  - 0% cross-tenant data leakage (verified through security testing)

Real_Time_Collaboration:
  - 100% of multi-user editing functionality working
  - 100% of real-time comment system functional
  - 100% of presence indicators working (<500ms updates)
  - 100% of conflict resolution working (optimistic locking + Yjs)
```

### Security Success Metrics
**Security Validation Targets:**

```yaml
Authentication_and_Authorization:
  - 0 security vulnerabilities in production (comprehensive testing)
  - 100% RLS policy test coverage (all access scenarios tested)
  - 100% API endpoint security validation (rate limiting, input validation)
  - 100% role-based access control validation (5-role system)

Data_Protection:
  - 0% unauthorized cross-tenant data access
  - 100% input sanitization for XSS prevention
  - 100% SQL injection prevention (RLS and parameterized queries)
  - API key security for SmartSuite and ElevenLabs integrations
```

### Integration Success Metrics
**SmartSuite Integration Validation:**

```yaml
Data_Synchronization:
  - 99.9% SmartSuite data synchronization accuracy
  - 99.9% background job processing reliability
  - <1% API integration error rate (with circuit breaker protection)
  - 100% data consistency maintained across systems

Role_Management:
  - 100% role mapping accuracy (SmartSuite → EAV 5-role system)
  - <10 second role change propagation time
  - 100% role-based access enforcement after sync
  - 0% role escalation vulnerabilities
```
