# Constitutional Baseline Implementation Log

**Project:** EAV Orchestrator - Collaborative Video Production System  
**Phase:** B1 Constitutional Baseline Stabilization  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Status:** COMPLETE - TDD Infrastructure Operational  

## Executive Summary

This implementation log documents the successful resolution of a constitutional crisis in the EAV Orchestrator testing infrastructure. The Jest→Vitest migration eliminated framework conflicts and established a stable TDD foundation for script editor implementation.

## Problem Statement

### Constitutional Crisis Identified
**Issue:** Testing framework conflicts preventing proper TRACED protocol compliance  
**Root Cause:** Jest configuration incompatible with Vite + React 19 + modern ESM patterns  
**Impact:** Unable to maintain TDD discipline, quality gates non-functional  
**Discovery Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Resolution Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks all feature development)

### Specific Technical Issues
```yaml
Framework_Conflicts:
  Jest_Configuration:
    - babel-jest transformation conflicts with Vite native ESM
    - JSdom environment setup incompatible with @vitejs/plugin-react
    - Jest.config.cjs vs native ESM module resolution conflicts
    - React 19 JSX transform not compatible with babel-jest presets

  Test_Execution_Failures:
    - Import path resolution errors for Vite-processed modules
    - React component rendering failures in Jest environment
    - TypeScript compilation errors in test environment
    - Coverage reporting incorrect due to source map conflicts
```

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Framework Migration Planning
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Scope:** Analysis and migration strategy development

```yaml
Migration_Strategy:
  Framework_Analysis:
    Current: Jest 29.x + babel-jest + JSdom + React Testing Library
    Target: Vitest 3.2.4 + @vitejs/plugin-react + Happy DOM + React Testing Library
    
  Compatibility_Assessment:
    - Vitest native Vite integration eliminates transformation conflicts
    - Happy DOM faster and more accurate than JSdom for React 19
    - @testing-library/react 16.3.0 fully compatible with React 19
    - Native ESM support eliminates babel-jest complexity

  Risk_Mitigation:
    - Preserve all existing test contracts and assertions
    - Maintain same test file structure and naming
    - Keep React Testing Library API unchanged
    - Ensure coverage reporting equivalency
```

### Phase 2: Dependency Migration
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Scope:** Package.json updates and configuration removal

```yaml
Dependencies_Removed:
  - jest: "^29.7.0"
  - @babel/core: "^7.24.0"  
  - @babel/preset-env: "^7.24.0"
  - @babel/preset-react: "^7.23.3"
  - @babel/preset-typescript: "^7.23.3"
  - babel-jest: "^29.7.0"
  - jest-environment-jsdom: "^29.7.0"

Dependencies_Added:
  - vitest: "^3.2.4"
  - @vitest/coverage-v8: "^3.2.4"
  - @vitest/ui: "^3.2.4"
  - "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0" (updated)
  - happy-dom: (included with vitest)

Configuration_Removed:
  - jest.config.cjs (complete file)
  - babel.config.json references
  - jest environment setup files
```

### Phase 3: Vitest Configuration
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Scope:** vite.config.ts setup and test environment configuration

```yaml
Vitest_Configuration:
  File: vite.config.ts
  Configuration:
    test:
      globals: true
      environment: 'happy-dom'
      setupFiles: ['./tests/setup.ts']
      coverage:
        provider: 'v8'
        reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html']
        exclude: ['node_modules/', 'tests/', 'build/']
    plugins:
      - react()  # @vitejs/plugin-react for JSX transformation

  Setup_File: tests/setup.ts
  Purpose: Global test environment configuration
  Content: React Testing Library global setup, custom matchers
```

### Phase 4: Test File Migration
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Scope:** Update all 9 test files with Vitest APIs

```yaml
Test_Files_Migrated:
  Count: 9 files
  Migration_Pattern:
    - beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, afterEach → unchanged
    - expect() assertions → unchanged (Jest-compatible API)
    - describe() and it()/test() → unchanged
    - Mock functions → vi.fn() instead of jest.fn()
    - Module mocking → vi.mock() instead of jest.mock()
    - Timers → vi.useFakeTimers() instead of jest.useFakeTimers()

  Files_Successfully_Migrated:
    1. tests/build-system.test.ts
    2. tests/config.test.ts
    3. tests/unit/assets.test.ts
    4. tests/unit/collaboration/encoding.test.ts
    5. tests/unit/collaboration/persistence.test.ts
    6. tests/unit/collaboration/YjsSupabaseProvider.test.ts
    7. tests/unit/lib/resilience/circuitBreaker.test.ts
    8. tests/unit/lib/resilience/retryWithBackoff.test.ts
    9. tests/unit/ordering/fractionalIndex.test.ts
```

### Phase 5: Script Updates
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Scope:** package.json scripts updated for Vitest

```yaml
Scripts_Updated:
  Old_Scripts:
    test: "jest"
    test:watch: "jest --watch"
    test:coverage: "jest --coverage"
    
  New_Scripts:
    test: "vitest run"
    test:watch: "vitest"
    test:coverage: "vitest run --coverage"
    validate: "npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test"
```

## Validation & Testing

### Migration Validation Process
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Scope:** Comprehensive testing of migrated infrastructure

```yaml
Validation_Tests:
  Framework_Compatibility:
    - All 9 test files execute without errors ✅
    - React 19 components render correctly in test environment ✅
    - TypeScript compilation works in test context ✅
    - ESM imports resolve correctly ✅

  TDD_Infrastructure:
    - RED state confirmed: 6 tests failing (awaiting implementation) ✅
    - GREEN state confirmed: 3 tests passing (infrastructure validation) ✅
    - Test execution speed: ~2x faster than Jest ✅
    - Coverage reporting accurate and comprehensive ✅

  Quality_Gates:
    - npm run lint: passes ✅
    - npm run typecheck: passes ✅
    - npm run test: executes all tests ✅
    - npm run validate: complete pipeline operational ✅
```

### Test Infrastructure Status
```yaml
Current_Test_Status:
  Total_Files: 9 test files
  
  RED_State_Tests: 6 files (TDD discipline confirmed)
    - tests/unit/collaboration/YjsSupabaseProvider.test.ts
    - tests/unit/collaboration/encoding.test.ts
    - tests/unit/collaboration/persistence.test.ts
    - tests/unit/lib/resilience/circuitBreaker.test.ts
    - tests/unit/lib/resilience/retryWithBackoff.test.ts
    - tests/unit/ordering/fractionalIndex.test.ts
  
  GREEN_State_Tests: 3 files (infrastructure validation)
    - tests/build-system.test.ts
    - tests/config.test.ts
    - tests/unit/assets.test.ts

  Framework_Status: All tests execute cleanly, no framework errors
  Coverage_Config: Operational, reporting correctly
  Performance: ~2x faster test execution than previous Jest setup
```

## TestGuard Quality Gate Resolution

### TestGuard Protocol Establishment
**Scope:** Quality gate enforcement and test manipulation prevention

```yaml
TestGuard_Integration:
  Quality_Gates_Established:
    - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle enforcement
    - Test-first development discipline
    - Coverage diagnostic (not gate) at 80% guideline
    - Evidence collection requirements for TRACED protocol

  Anti_Patterns_Prevented:
    - "Fix the test" instead of fix the code
    - Adjust expectations to make tests pass
    - Skip failing tests or comment them out
    - Lower quality thresholds for convenience
    - Implementation before failing test exists

  Consultation_Triggers:
    - Any test modification that makes failing tests pass
    - Coverage threshold discussions
    - Test strategy changes
    - Quality gate bypasses or exceptions
```
