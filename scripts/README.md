# Scripts Directory

**Purpose:** Automation tools, generators, validators, and development utilities

## Future Content (9xx Category)

### 9xx :: SCRIPTS_TOOLS Range
When scripts are added, they should follow documentation standards:

```
901-SCRIPT-VALIDATION-HOOKS.md        # Pre-commit hook documentation
902-SCRIPT-DOC-GENERATORS.md          # Documentation generation tools
903-SCRIPT-DEPLOYMENT-AUTOMATION.md   # Deployment scripts
904-SCRIPT-TEST-UTILITIES.md          # Testing support scripts
905-SCRIPT-DEVELOPMENT-TOOLS.md       # Development environment setup
```

## Current Status

This directory is prepared for future automation needs but currently empty. As the EAV Orchestrator project grows, scripts will be added in these categories:

### Planned Script Categories
- **Validation Scripts:** Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD validation
- **Documentation Tools:** Auto-generation, link checking, format validation
- **Development Utilities:** Environment setup, database seeding, mock data
- **Deployment Automation:** Build scripts, container management, deployment
- **Testing Support:** Test data generation, coverage reporting, performance testing

## Guidelines

### Script Documentation
Each significant script or tool should have corresponding documentation in the 9xx range explaining:
- Purpose and usage
- Configuration options
- Integration points
- Maintenance procedures

### Organization
- Keep actual scripts in appropriate directories (`scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, etc.)
- Document scripts in `docs/9xx-SCRIPT-*.md` files
- Reference scripts from main project documentation

---

**Status:** Prepared for future expansion as automation needs emerge
