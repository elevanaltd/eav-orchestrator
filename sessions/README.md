# Sessions Directory

**Purpose:** Raw logs, explorations, scratch work, and conversation records

## Content Guidelines

### What Belongs Here
- Development session logs
- Exploration notes and prototyping
- Scratch documents and rough drafts  
- Conversation transcripts
- Work-in-progress materials

### What Does NOT Belong Here
- Finalized documentation (belongs in `docs/`)
- Archived materials (belongs in `_archive/`)
- Official standards or guides
- Production-ready artifacts

## Organization

### No Strict Standards Applied
Unlike other directories, `sessions/` is **lint-relaxed**:
- Flexible naming conventions
- No required structure
- Informal organization acceptable
- Focus on utility over formality

### Cleanup Guidelines
- Periodically review and clean up obsolete content
- Extract valuable insights to proper documentation
- Delete ephemeral content after usefulness expires
- Avoid long-term accumulation of scratch materials

## Suggested Structure (Optional)

```
sessions/
├── YYYY-MM-DD-topic/           # Date-based session folders
├── explorations/               # Research and prototyping
├── scratch/                    # Temporary work files
└── transcripts/                # Conversation records
```

**Note:** This directory is intentionally informal to support creative and exploratory work without bureaucratic overhead.
